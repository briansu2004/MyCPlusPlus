```cpp
#include <pistache/endpoint.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace Pistache;

class MyHandler : public Http::Handler {
public:
    HTTP_PROTOTYPE(MyHandler)

    void onRequest(const Http::Request& request, Http::ResponseWriter response) override {
        if (request.method() == Http::Method::Get && request.resource() == "/hello") {
            response.send(Http::Code::Ok, "Hello, World!");
        } else {
            response.send(Http::Code::Not_Found);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Http::listenAndServe<MyHandler>("*:8080");
    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic example that creates a simple REST API using Pistache, responding with "Hello, World!" when accessing the "/hello" endpoint. Depending on your requirements, you would expand upon this by adding more routes, implementing business logic, and integrating with databases or external services as needed.

## A C# application and its model wrappers written in C++

Creating model wrappers in C++ for use in a C# application involves interop between the two languages. This typically entails using techniques such as Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke) or creating a Managed C++ (C++/CLI) wrapper. Here's a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:

### Option 1: P/Invoke

1. **Write C++ Code:** Implement your model classes or functionality in C++.
2. **Expose Functions:** Expose functions in your C++ code that wrap the functionality you want to use in your C# application. These functions should use `extern "C"` linkage to ensure they have C linkage, which is necessary for interop.
3. **Define P/Invoke Signatures:** In your C# application, define P/Invoke signatures for the functions you want to call from the C++ code.
4. **Call C++ Functions:** Use the P/Invoke signatures to call the C++ functions from your C# code.

### Option 2: Managed C++ (C++/CLI)

1. **Write Managed C++ Code:** Create a Managed C++ project within your solution.
2. **Write Wrappers:** Write wrapper classes in Managed C++ that expose the functionality of your C++ code to C#. Managed C++ allows you to mix native and managed code in the same project.
3. **Build Assembly:** Build the Managed C++ project to produce a .NET assembly (DLL).
4. **Reference in C#:** Reference the generated assembly in your C# project.
5. **Use in C#:** Use the wrapper classes from the Managed C++ assembly in your C# code as if they were regular .NET classes.

### Example

Let's say you have a simple C++ class for a "Person" with `getName()` and `setName()` methods.

**C++ Code (Person.h):**

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <string>

class Person {
public:
    Person();
    std::string getName();
    void setName(const std::string& name);
private:
    std::string name;
};
```

**C++ Implementation (Person.cpp):**

```cpp
#include "Person.h"

Person::Person() {}

std::string Person::getName() {
    return name;
}

void Person::setName(const std::string& name) {
    this->name = name;
}
```

### Example Option 1: P/Invoke

**C# P/Invoke:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class Program {
    [DllImport("YourCppLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern IntPtr CreatePerson();

    [DllImport("YourCppLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern void Person_SetName(IntPtr person, string name);

    [DllImport("YourCppLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern string Person_GetName(IntPtr person);

    static void Main(string[] args) {
        IntPtr person = CreatePerson();
        Person_SetName(person, "John Doe");
        string name = Person_GetName(person);
        Console.WriteLine(name); // Output: John Doe
    }
}
```

### Example Option 2: Managed C++ (C++/CLI)

**Managed C++ Wrapper:**

```cpp
#pragma once
#include "Person.h"

public ref class PersonWrapper {
public:
    PersonWrapper() {
        person = new Person();
    }

    ~PersonWrapper() {
        delete person;
    }

    void SetName(System::String^ name) {
        marshal_context context;
        person->setName(context.marshal_as<std::string>(name));
    }

    System::String^ GetName() {
        return gcnew System::String(person->getName().c_str());
    }

private:
    Person* person;
};
```

In this example, `PersonWrapper` acts as a bridge between the C++ `Person` class and the C# application, providing a managed interface for interacting with the native C++ code. You would then use `PersonWrapper` in your C# application as you would any other .NET class.

Choose the option that best fits your project requirements and familiarity with the technologies involved.
